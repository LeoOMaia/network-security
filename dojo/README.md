# GT-CRIVO DefectDojo extensions

Our project has made three main extensions to DefectDojo.  A key requirement our extensions support is that they make *zero* changes to DefectDojo's models or database; this ensures that any deployment using our extensions can be trivially reverted to a vanilla DefectDojo deployment by just changing the codebase.  Our extensions add:

1. The ability to group `Findings` into `Problems`.  Our extension receives as input any mapping of `Findings` to `Problems`; one of which we have built using Artificial Intelligence to analyze the detection scripts used by scanning techniques.

2. The ability for analysts to specify the priority of a vulnerability (a `Vote`).  This is integrated with Dojo's interface, and the information used to train the vulnerability prioritization model developed in the project. `Vote`s are stored in a separate SQLite database.

3. Integration of complementary metadata which aid analysts investigate and troubleshoot a `Finding`.  The metadata are downloaded directly from [authoritative](https://www.first.org/epss/) [sources](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog), and shown in Dojo's `Finding` view.  Some of the metadata we integrate [are also available as a paid feature in Dojo's Pro subscription](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/discussions/11796), which helps illustrate their usefulness.

> A `Finding` is DefectDojo's terminology for any result (or "finding") reported by any of the integrated tools.  A `Finding` is somewhat of a catch-all structure given the wide spectrum of tools supported by DefectDojo, whose results are all stored in the same `Finding` class.  In the context of our project, `Finding`s come from network vulnerability scanners like Nuclei, Nmap, and OpenVAS.

## Installation

Installation of our extensions follows the [normal installation procedure for DefectDojo](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/blob/master/readme-docs/DOCKER.md).  You should just follow the installation procedure on top of [our development branch](https://github.com/LeoOMaia/django-DefectDojo/tree/redis-problems).  (TODO: link to release on RNP's Git.)  We frequently rebase our changes on top of Dojo's `master` branch to keep up to date with fixes and improvements on the platform, which also makes it easy to check [the changes we have made to the code](https://github.com/DefectDojo/django-DefectDojo/compare/master...LeoOMaia:django-DefectDojo:redis-problems).  (TODO: link to diff in RNP's Git.)

## Configuration

The development branch is already preconfigured to run Dojo with the default configuration for our extensions.  Following Dojo's installation procedure on top of our branch without any additional changes should get you a working deployment with the extensions preconfigured.  The information below is provided as documentation.

We inject the configuration inside Dojo's running container by mounting a Docker volume inside the container.  The volume configuration is inside Dojo's `docker-compose.yml` file (TODO: permalink), and mounts the `crivo-metadata` directory inside our branch at `/app/crivo-metadata` inside the container.

The configuration parameters below should be set inside Dojo's (actually Django's) `local_settings.py` file. (TODO: permalink)  The required files mentioned in the subsections below are already added to the `crivo-metadata` directory (TODO), and pointed to by the `local_settings.py`

### `Problem` Mappings

`Finding` to `Problem` mappings should be provided as either an `https` or `file` URL in the `PROBLEM_MAPPINGS_JSON_URL` configuration variable.  If this variable is not provided, the `Problem` tab will simply not show up in the interface, maintaining to Dojo's default functionality.

The mapping generated in the project is available over HTTPS and can be configured as follows.  Our mapping groups `Findings` from Nmap, OpenVAS, Nuclei, and Metasploit.

```python
PROBLEM_MAPPINGS_JSON_URL = "https://pugna.snes.dcc.ufmg.br/defectdojo/disambiguator.json"
```

A local `file` URL needs to point to where our metadata volume is mounted inside the container, like:

```python
PROBLEM_MAPPINGS_JSON_URL = "file:///app/crivo-metadata/disambiguator.json"
```

### `Vote` Database

The `Vote` database is totally separate from Dojo's PostgreSQL database.  We store analyst votes in a SQLite database that is stored in the metadata volume.  Only `file` URLs are supported:

```python
VOTE_DB_URL = "file:///app/crivo-metadata/vote-db.sqlite3"
```

> After we have data to train a prioritization model, it will be added to the metadata directory and a corresponding configuration entry will be added.

### Other Metadata

The additional metadata is also stored inside the `crivo-metadata` volume.  We currently support metadata to show the EPSS assigned to CVEs related to a vulnerability, downloaded directly from [FIRST](https://www.first.org/epss/); whether any CVE is in the [Known Exploited Vulnerabilities database](https://www.cisa.gov/known-exploited-vulnerabilities-catalog); and a classification of impact of CVEs generated by the project using language models on the CVE description text.  These are configured with the following:

```python
# https://epss.cyentia.com/epss_scores-current.csv.gz
EPSS_DB_CSV_URL = "file:///app/crivo-metadata/epss_scores.csv.gz"
# https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/feeds/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json
KEV_DB_JSON_URL = "file:///app/crivo-metadata/known_exploited_vulnerabilities.json"
CVE_CLASSIFICATION_JSON_URL = "file:///app/crivo-metadata/cve-classification.pkl.gz"
```
